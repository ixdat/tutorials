    "Note: When using ixdat's native methods, you can also use the method ``gas_flux_calibration_curve``, to which you can pass several timespans corresponding to different gas compositions, i.e. you will get a multi-point calibration in a similar way as from the EC calibration. However, this method relies on the calculation of the flux of the carrier gas through the capillary and assumes that this flux will not be affected by the change in gas composition due to the analytes. This assumption likely holds as long as the gas concentration is <10% (better <1%), but is ideally only used for small analyte concentrations. This function has not been translated to use the spectro_inlets_quantification plugin, which will allow it to consider the influence of the analyte on the carrier gas. This will hopefully be done in the near future. "
